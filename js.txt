var
let
const

we can define variable by let var const

{ let a = 9 } if we use let in a scope then we cant be allow to use it outside the scope. so let is block scope
{ var a = 10} but we can use var outside the scope. so var is function scope.
const a = 10 const is constant if we define const then we cant channge the value. its constant.


function scope and local scope

functon scope = har function create new scope and we defined variable in a function then we cant 
access outside of the function because it a local variable

local scope = variables declared inside a function scope or block, its a local variable and it can be only use 
inside the function.

Hoisting

variable and function declarations are moved to the top of 
their respective scopes during the compilation phase
