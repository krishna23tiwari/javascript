const x1 = {

// console.log(x1.id);

// here we are trying to get value from object so for that we have to do x1.(key name) again and again
// but here we can also use { here we write name which we have to access} = object name
// and if we want to change name then like here we use email to eml {email: eml} so we can short that name
// its called destructuring 

const {email: eml} = x1

// console.log(eml);

// const navabar = ({company}) =>{

// navabar(company =  "kk")

//=========================API=============================================
//api file comes in json
//we can say its kind of object but not object because we declere name of the object but in json
// keys and values both are in string format
