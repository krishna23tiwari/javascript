const x1 = {

}

// console.log(x1.id);

// here we are trying to get value from object so for that we have to do x1.(key name) again and again
// but here we can also use { here we write name which we have to access} = object name
// and if we want to change name then like here we use email to eml {email: eml} so we can short that name
// its called destructuring 

const {email: eml} = x1

// console.log(eml);

// const navabar = ({company}) =>{

// navabar(company =  "kk")
